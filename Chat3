how to integrate with react-hook-form properly
achieve these points "Convert components to use Controller everywhere (cleaner integration).

Add accessibility tweaks (aria labels, keyboard navigation improvements).

Wire real OAuth via NextAuth and show API endpoints.

Provide an isolated repo/example ZIP for quick testing." give me the examples with explaination step by step

And where to keep Controller file. in the nextjs

----------------------------------------------------

Done â€” I reviewed and fixed bugs across the entire code sample and rewrote the document. The main fixes:

* Added the missing `Textarea` component.
* Ensured all labels have `id` attributes and ARIA references (`aria-labelledby` / `aria-describedby`) are consistent.
* Fixed controller wiring edge-cases (explicitly passing values to components and ensuring `onChange` signatures match).
* Hardened keyboard handling in `RadioGroup`.
* Defensive checks and clearer default values in inputs and selects.
* Mapped server-side errors back to form fields in the registration page using `setError`.

The updated code is saved in the canvas under **Nextjs15-rhf-nextauth-form-example**.
